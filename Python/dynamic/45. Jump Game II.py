#     You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at nums[0].

# Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other words, if you are at nums[i],
# you can jump to any nums[i + j] where:

#     0 <= j <= nums[i] and
#     i + j < n

# Return the minimum number of jumps to reach nums[n - 1]. The test cases are generated such that you can reach nums[n - 1].

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
# Output: 2
